Tile Solution includes the Tile Engine, and a Tile Editor

Tile Engine
	
	- Engine for the running and development of Tile-Based MonoGame games
	
Tile Editor
	
	- Editor for the creation of Layered Tile-Maps for MonoGame games

	
Languages / Tools Used

	- MonoGame Framework, WinForms, C#

Goals of this project includes

	- To Learn about Tile-Engines and Game Editors, as well as increase 
	  knowledge on the MonoGame Framework

	- To create a re-usable Tile-Engine and Tile-Editor for the creation and 
	  enjoyment of Tile-Based MonoGame games
	  
	  
Current Roadmaps
	
	- Implement Drag and Drag feature for Tile Layer list box (for easier control of layer levels)
	
	- Introduce a "Draw-To" layer drop down box that will populate depending on selected Tile Layers.
	  Then when editing, features will be applied to the layer in the "Draw-To" box.
	
	- Implement Tile collision system that can be used by a collision engine
	
	- Implement XML property files for the saving and loading of Tile Layer Layouts and their properties
	
	- Introduce Partition Tree optimizations for drawing in Game-mode (only draw tiles in the visible partition)
